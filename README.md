# 2011 & 2021 UK Census EDA

## Introduction

The UK has a growing ageing population [^1], which is a threat to the economic output of the country. With this fact, it was hypothesised that this demographic shift would suggest a reduction in the working population. Preliminary analysis of the 2011 and 2021 census data [^2,^3] for England and Wales validated the initial hypothesis to an extent; however, there were several regions which suggested that age was not the only reason for a decrease in the employment rate. As such it was thought that education might be a contributing factor due to its intrinsic link with work [^4]. This gave rise to the overarching question for exploratory analysis: what is the relationship between economic activity and education in England and Wales in 2021? To answer the main question, two sub-questions were curated based on the available census data:
1. What is the age/gender demographic relationship between economic activity and qualification level?
2. What is the relationship between working conditions and qualification level?

Using Munzer’s task taxonomy [^5] a Tableau storyboard, consisting of three dashboards, was produced to demonstrate the preliminary analysis and the two sub-questions. The visualisation was made with the consideration that the primary user would be a non-domain specialist in the given socio-economic areas who may also use the storyboard to answer personal research questions or for exploration. As such the three key requirements were:
- Visualisations must be easy to interpret in terms of what each view shows
- Filters/interactivity must be kept intuitive
- Dashboards can be used as standalone visualisation tools for personal exploration

This report follows Munzer’s ‘What-Why-How’ structure [^5] to explain the steps taken for building the visualisation. ‘Data Preparation and Abstraction’ addresses ‘What’ is shown to the user. ‘Task Definition’ addresses ‘Why’ the user is looking at what they see. ‘Visual Justification’ addresses the ‘How’ by justifying the visual encoding/interaction of idioms using information visualisation principles. Additionally, the ‘Evaluation’ section summarizes the results of a small validation study to assess the suitability of the visualisation for the primary user.
